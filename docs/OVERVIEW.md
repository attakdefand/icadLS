# Overview

## Project Purpose

ICALDS (Identify Codes, Algorithms, and Data Structures) is designed to help developers and students identify, analyze, and understand various programming constructs including:

1. **Code Patterns**: Recognize common coding patterns and anti-patterns
2. **Algorithms**: Identify algorithmic approaches and analyze their complexity
3. **Data Structures**: Detect and classify data structures used in code

## Architecture

The project follows a microservices architecture with:

- **Analyzer API**: Core service that performs the analysis
- **Web Advisor**: Browser-based interface for interactive use
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities for local analysis

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Rust (for performance and safety)
- **Frontend**: Rust/WASM with Yew framework
- **Deployment**: Docker containers
- **API**: RESTful interface

## Use Cases

1. **Educational Tool**: Help students understand code constructs
2. **Code Review**: Assist in identifying patterns during code reviews
3. **Performance Optimization**: Recommend better algorithms/data structures
4. **Learning Aid**: Explain complex code to developers
